# todo 
# - add more examples and documentation for all procedures
# - support and test other endianesses (for now, only 'little endian' is tested)
# - specify your own order of output dimensions (an not based on the first input files)

# low priority:
# - allow both file name list and coordinate selection in it
# - rewrite rwicecubeps to have a more comprehensive sorting way (define its sorting behaviour from the calling routine)

# - only add dimension if dim > 1
