# - look after dependencies in the packages (e.g. on numpy, sciproc, Scientific.IO.NetCDF etc.) 
# - support and test endianesses (for now, only 'little endian' machines are tested)
# - add debug info option
# - specify your own order of output dimensions (so not based on the first input files)
# - provide a squeeze()-like option, i.e. remove the 1-dimensions from the variables?
# - provide an ubuntu/debian repository (launchpad.net)
# - add more examples and documentation for all procedures
# - provide the code with more extensive explanation

# low priority (or lots of work):
# - allow both file name list and coordinate selection in it
# - rewrite/restructure rwicecubeps to have a more comprehensive sorting way (define its sorting behaviour from the calling routine)
# - for now, the possibility of sizes of the data buffer depends on the
#   dimensions of the data input. Rewrite the code, so that also chunks of
#   intermediate size can be read as well.
# - make a cdo-like command line interface (please let me know if you or someone else wants to contribute to this)
