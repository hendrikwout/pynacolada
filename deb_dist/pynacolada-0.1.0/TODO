# todo 
# - support for variable endianess (now little endian)
# - specify your own order of output dimensions (an not based on the first input files)

# - allow both file name list and coordinate selection in it
# - rewrite rwicecubeps to have a more comprehensive sorting way (define its sorting behaviour from the calling routine)

# - only add dimension if dim > 1
